# sysadmin-scripts
Utility BASH scripts for basic system administration. Once downloaded, a script in this repository can be run from Bash shells via the command `./[script-filepath]` or via aliasing (see the [Options](#options) section below).

## Script Index
- **cleanup-old.sh**: A programmatic broom, used in order to sweep away dusty old files
- **automail.sh**: An automated mail service for sending delayed or periodic emails

## Options
These scripts can be made into permanent commands (like `echo` or `grep`, for example) fairly easily. There is more than one way to do this:

- Create a ~/bin folder with `mkdir $HOME/bin`, and add the script to that folder (perhaps through `mv [script-filepath] $HOME/bin`). Then put ~/bin on the PATH with the command `export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/bin`. If you want to execute the command Ã  la builtin command (i.e. without the ".sh" extension), feel free to delete aforementioned extension.
- Alternatively, you can create an alias for the command. A temporary alias can be created with `alias command-name='./[script-filepath]'`, while a permanent alias will require the same command to be added to the ~/.bash_profile and/or ~/.bashrc file.

##  Troubleshooting + FAQ
**I don't have permission to execute the file!** 

You can give yourself execute permission via the command `chmod +x [script-filepath]`.
