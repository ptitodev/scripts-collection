This is a traceroute-browser/admin userinterface:

This is designed if you use MTR (http://www.bitwizard.nl/mtr/) as a traceroute/ping program
You can add sites, places from where you traceroute and all in the info to a 
database en then look at different traceroutes from one site on one screen, 
and then eventually print them. You can set the order to see them on screen and so on
quite easy :)

INSTALL

- Make a database (MySQL) named 'traceroute' and dump the 'dump.sql' file in the database.
- change the connect.inc.php file to make the connection to your database
- also set in the connect.inc.php the 'valign' value= this is important for the print on screen, if the colums start at top or bottom (to see when the traces come together 
at one point :)
- do a chmod on the 'data.txt' (777) (if you 're on linux ! - on windows there shouldn't be a problem duhuh :p), 
this is a temporary file to write stuff in, if you don't the thing won't work
