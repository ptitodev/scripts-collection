What is this ?
**************

This is a little perl script for importing log files generated by MTR.
It's more easy to log the tracing and then import it in the database for :
	- the logging stops at an certain moment
	- copy/paste is not that easy !


What do you need ?
******************
You must have installed already the traceroute mysqldatabase, that also comes in the tar.
Also, you need DBI, a perl module to make a connection with the mysql.


Why use this ?
**************
Statistics are more detailed if you log your reports in a file, rather then copy/pasting it !


How to use ?
************
First of all, you must have a file so the perl script can parse it into the database.

1) Adjust the vars in the mtrlogimport-file (user & paswoord and so on)

2) To log mtr-stats in a file just do this :

   mtr --report -c #nr www.hostname.com > file.txt

   --report: is the function that logs the tracing 
   -c      : (count); number of counts before stopping
   #nr     : is a number you fill in here, if put five, the report will be written after five traces

3) then run the perlscript :

   - First, do chmod +x mtrlogimport so you can execute the file !
   Now you can run it:
   ./mtrlogimport

   He will ask you for :
   - Site = the site/domain you have traced
   - From = From where did you trace
   - Then he will just import the logfile in the database

NOTE:  the program will stop if the filename is not found, if no connection can be made with mysql, if you choose to stop at the end 
or euh ctrl C or a crash :p
