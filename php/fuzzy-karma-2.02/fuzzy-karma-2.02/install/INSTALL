INSTALLATION Instructions

***********
IMPORTANT NOTE
***********
	FUZZY REQUIRES THAT SNORT BE INSTALLED WITH MYSQL SUPPORT!!!
	FUZZY WILL NOT RUN WITHOUT SNORT!
	IF YOU DO NOT ALREADY HAVE SNORT WITH MYSQL RUNNING ON YOUR SYSTEM, THEN PLEASE
	VISIT HTTP://WWW.SNORT.ORG FOR INFORMATION ON DOWLOADING AND INSTALLING IT.


	These instructions are for the Karma version of FUZZY (2.0).  These instructions
will not work for previous versions of FUZZY, nor are they guaranteed to work for later
versions.
	Unzip the .tar.gz file into a location of your choice (somewhere
that your web server will have access to).  Once the files are unzipped, fuzzy is already
almost ready to go!  Before you start using it, you need to do the following things:

Install the SNORT rules:
	To be able to use fuzzy with snort, there are some custom rules that you must include
with snort.  These rules are in  file called 'fuzzy.rules' in the install directory.  Copy these
rules into your existing snort rules directory (often /etc/snort/).  Now add to the snort.conf file
the option to include fuzzy.rules in the filtering.  This is done by adding the following line to
the file (it is custom to put this at the end of the file): include $RULE_PATH/fuzzy.rules
	In order to begin filtering with these rules, you must restart SNORT.  WE HIGHLY RECOMMEND
THAT YOU DO NOT RESTART SNORT UNTIL THE REST OF FUZZY IS READY TO RUN!
	If you plan to run FUZZY as a stand-alone system without using SNORT to as an IDS or anything else,
then we recommend COMMENTING OUT ALL OF THE OTHER INCLUDES.  This will prevent SNORT from filling up
with extraneous alerts.

Create fuzzy database:
	There is a database schema file located in the install directory.  You must run this file in
MySQL to set up the database correctly.  FUZZY uses the snort database, so if your snort database is
called 'snort' then you would run this command (or something similar, depending on your system):
	mysql -p snort < fuzzy_db.install (it will then prompt for your password).
	You must have write access to snort in order to do this.  Also, you must either be located
in the install directory, or insert the absolute path of the file into the command.

Edit the config file:
	In the future we will have an install script that does this for you, but for now you 
have to edit the configuration file manually.  The configuration file is found in the 'etc'
directory of the Fuzzy Root directory.  The file is called "conf.php".  Edit the file according
to the instructions provided in the file.

Start-up the background processes:
	You are almost done!  Now you just need to get the two background processes that FUZZY requires
to start up.  You MUST run these processes as a user with WRITE access to the [path_to_fuzzy]/var
directory!  So either give your user write access, recursively set the owner of the var directory to your
user, or run the background processes as root--your decision.
	The two processes that need to be run are found in the 'cron' directory of fuzzy.  They are,
'analyze.php' and 'collect.php'.  You must run these using PHP, but not as a module.  To do this, issue
the following commands: 
[path_to_php]/php [path_to_fuzzy]/cron/collect.php &
[path_to_php]/php [path_to_fuzzy]/cron/analyze.php &
	For example, if your php binary is found in /usr/local/bin/php and fuzzy is in /usr/local/apache2/htdocs/fuzzy
then you would type:
/usr/local/bin/php /usr/local/apache2/htdocs/fuzzy/cron/collect.php &
/usr/local/bin/php /usr/local/apache2/htdocs/fuzzy/cron/analyze.php &

Log-in and change password:
	Now that you have the background processes running, you may restart SNORT and you are ready to go!
To login, use a web browser to open the 'index.php' file and login with the user name 'admin' and password
'admin'.  You can change the password after logging in.
