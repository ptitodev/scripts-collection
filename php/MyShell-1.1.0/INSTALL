GETTING THE PROGRAM
-------------------
You can always get the latest version of MyShell from
http://www.digitart.net/php/myshell 


INSTALLATION
------------
Installation is easy but may differ slightly if you have
shell access or not in your server:

With shell access:
1. Create the directory where MyShell will live
   and upload the MyShell-1.x.x.tar.gz
   i.e.: mkdir myshell
2. untar it using tar -zxvf MyShell-1.x.x.tar.gz
3. with your favorite editor edit shell.php
4. Point your browser to the URL of shell.php
   i.e.: http://your.server.com/myshell/shell.php

Without shell access:
1. Untar MyShell-1.x.x.tar.gz in your computer
2. Edit shell.php to suit your needs
3. Upload shell.php and companion files to your server using FTP
4. Point your browser to the URL of shell.php
   i.e.: http://your.server.com/myshell/shell.php
   
shell.php is the only file needed to run MyShell, but
hey!, please don't keep the docummentation aside. 


Password-protecting MyShell
-----------------------------
MyShell is a higly risky script in the wrong hands.
It is important that you password-protect MyShell, otherwise everybody
can have access to your webserver over the Internet. They will be
able to erase your files, and perhaps even shutdown the webserver!
So be careful with this and remember that you can always find the
usual disclaimer in the file LICENSE. (This software is licensed under
GPL, I'm not responsible if you blow things up, etc... :-)

BUILT IN PASSWORD-PROTECTION
----------------------------
MyShell includes a built in password protection configurable
from the shell.php file itself.
Althought basic, it's quite efective, do not requiere
to have cookies enabeled on your browser nor any external file,
and emails you a warning message when someone tries to login with 
an invalid username or password.

USING APACHE .htaccess PROTECTION
---------------------------------
You can also use .htaccess to password-protect MyShell but you
have to disable the built in password protection, otherwise you
certanly won't be able to access MyShell.

For any help on the subject, you can install MyShell and type:

man htpasswd

You can also use the included sample.htaccess as the template for your
own .htaccess file.
To do so, first rename it to .htaccess, and then if you already have a
file with usernames and passwords for Apache, just change the bit
saying <path to auth-file> to the path of you file.

If you don't have such .htpasswd file, then creating one is easy. 
Type the following as root from a real shell or telnet session:

$ htpasswd -c /home/httpd/auth_users <username>

This will create the file /home/httpd/auth_users and promt for a
password for the username supplied. If your Apache is installed
somewhere else, then just adjust the path in both the command above
and in the .htaccess-file.
If you need to add extra usernames and passwords, then leave out the
-c in the command above.

BUILT-IN FILE EDITOR
--------------------
You can edit any file on your webspace provided you have
the permissions required.
To invoke the editor type 'edit filename'.
Bear in mind that you can change the command to invoke the
editor. If you are used to pico or vi, you can change the command
editing shell.php to use 'pico filename' or 'vi filename' or whatever
you prefer. Please refer to the comments in the code.
