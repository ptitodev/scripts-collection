   * shell.php 1.1.0:
    -Almost full rewritten. Now code works also with PHP3>= 3.0.11 
     (functions defined before being called. Thanks to Marc Harth 
     for the bug report).
    -Now 95% of the code is diferent from phpShell
    -New built-in editor.
      >Now you can edit files directly from MyShell
      >Save the file with the same name or rename it on the fly
      >Create a new file directly from the editor
      >Use your prefered command name to invoke editor (pico, vi etc. This is
       only an alias, real pico or vi programs can't be run from MyShell)
      >Report file's owner and permissions in the editor screen
      >Fast exit from the editor just typing a command
      >Select Wrap or Wrap OFF for editor, useful in code files with long lines
    -Command filter to prevent execution of commands that can't be run from
     a web interface, like pico, vi, xterm, top etc.
     Besides, now you can define your own list of commands that you don't want
     you or your users to excecute from MyShell, i.e.: kill, dig, rm etc. 
       
   * shell.php 1.0.7:
    -Fixed the slashes problem in parameters using " and '
     Now you can use commands like  dig www.yourserver.com  -v "^;;"
     (thanks to Tom@xsurf.net for the bug report)
    -Fixed some spelling errors in code, comments and reports.
     Sorry, english is not my native language, as you can tell ;-)

   * shell.php 1.0.6:
    -Fixed a bug when using "" in the arguments of a command.
     Now you can use "" and '' as well.
    -Added permanent report of the user name of your server
     using whoami

   * shell.php 1.0.5:

    -New Look. Now it's more like a terminal.
    -cd command added. Now you can use cd command to change directory.
