This software is under the GNU Public License (GPL) 



DESCRIPTION:
Pcom is a PHP-driven webtelnet, that is a web interface to execute shell
commands/external programs on a server. Obviously there are limitations,
derived mainly by security limitations on the webserver (ie safe_mode
in php). There is also a limitation on the program function itself,
because you can only use non-interactive commands: you can launch
a command or a program that doesn't need user interaction, but you
cannot use something like lynx or irc (you can onlylaunch an interactive
application in background, driving it automatically by arguments and/or
scripts -where possible-). 
Remember that you can only launch a command, you don't drive a real
shell. So, if you launch a ping it will go forever because you cannot
take back the control on the stdin, while launching a traceroute you should
get back control and output of the command because it terminates itself
without user interaction.


INSTALLATION:
Unpack the archive, copy pcom.jpg and pcom.php3 files in your
webserver and enjoy. Tested only on Apache and PHP (as module),
without any limitation (bad idea :P) in configuration, such as
safe_mode and all the other security stuff.


DISCLAIMER:
I know this software is potentially dangerous, but YOU (have to) 
know that PHP can limit things like this easily. Use it at
your own risk. 


That's all!
