Short Term:
----------

Investigate tree layout of info
	For user administration in displayaccess and area/range display
	Use php-layers menu system
Customer should only see his own data
	add multiple groups to a customer
	update docs about how groups work and also anonymous access
	createcust attrib should also be part of auth class
		second bit?
Displayoverlap
	Appears to not show all customers when group auth
Printing
	Create @print additions to main.css file, provide print button on pages
Change auth.php to be more modular for external authentication
	ldap?
	when obtaining groups via auth, pass group attribs too
Alternate auth
	http://sourceforge.net/projects/tackle/
Matrix for free space
	divided into class C blocks - green all free, yellow partly free
		red all used
Attach user to registrar via selection - can send to one only or all?
Does custom error handler break API?
	see sf request
move of subnet used wrong group - used ip address modify group, not subnet modify group!!!
http://jodies.de/ipcalc
	add something like this to the boring start/homepage?
template
	fulltext search feature?
	re-use variables to conserve memory
	various templates per network object, ie selectable?
		select template on IP record and store in infobinfn
Uploaded files
	authentication - can anybody see all files?
Unique number for uploaded filenames
	$better_token = md5(uniqid(rand(), true));
Find gaps in series
	http://www.mail-archive.com/mysql@lists.mysql.com/msg46223.html
Save previous info in auditlog
	done for ip records, add to more places
Add, update functions for IP recs in dbf class should be arrays -
	makes easier to add additional fields.
Check 
	http://sourceforge.net/forum/forum.php?thread_id=1246266&forum_id=101034
Debug and Location: header do not work
Appears odd that md5sum has group by? On non indexed column lastmod?
Link from displaysubnet page to search for DNS zone A records if hname field completed
Use md5 passwd in config.php for admin user
RowLock and UserTimeStamp fixes in adodb?
	Add RowLock() to prevent transaction issues
Check out PageExecute
http://www.internetassociatesllc.com/ - matrix view
Logout?
	$user = 'user';
	$pass = 'pass';
	header("Authorization: Basic " . base64endode("$user:$pass"));
SNMP_COMMUNITY not hardcoded - should be per customer or subnet? Use template field when
	available - being done as part of DHCP code
Allow changing field seperator - idea by Frank Elsner
	should be selectable on screen?
Some places cannot bookmark pages due to actions - need to strip and use Location: header
	join/split has action issues on page reload - check other places
		same for modify descrip etc
	cannot use location as cannot then see messages displayed
The show used addresses will not change the color of the address whether it's
	probe is successful or not. Solaris
	is this a safe mode issue?
Modifybase search is wrong format
Complete better search 
	save displaysubnet search in cookie
Warning if subnet gets low on free addresses
	Possibly email? What is criteria? Size of subnet > than 128
		and less than 5 free? Config options
		Andy Wilson - Irish Broadband
Edit button on displaysubnet page - jump to modify subnet, exportdhcp too.
Linked addresses - option to link bidirectional for 1-1 NAT - extra
	button which then completes other side
	Consider linked addresses across customers
	Multiple linked addresses per address - see sf 1252209
Perl network crawler via snmp to document network/routing.
	http://snmp-info.sourceforge.net/
Tweak div boxes to fill entire screen
Expand searches in displaysubnet to also search on other fields
Add check all button back to modifybase - should be dependent of "paranoid" option
Install overwrites templates and config file, need better way to handle this
Language should be choosen in header, not each script?
XMLRPC needs updating - security fix
	http://phpxmlrpc.sourceforge.net/
	http://pear.php.net/package/XML_RPC/
Test anonymous access
Md5sum added to modifyipform var list - for file upload?
Poller
	update hname field with DNS entry when doing poll?
Subnet request page feature
Test DNS deleted/submit on other page - extra safety checks
Add colour to reserved addresses on displaysubnet - yellow
Searchall - search across all fields
Should rollback transactions if error?
Check filepath of zones - can have illegal chars like < etc
	check for UNC paths too
Requestip pager/deleter for admin user
Some way of generating an A record automatically if it does not exist
	Does this check if user is allowed to modify zone records?
	button on displayform to create record




IPplanAPI:
---------

Check: whoisd must run as root, cannot run under safemode
Cannot access template vars 

DNS management:
--------------
Update internals docs
Have search button to find duplicate IP addresses across zones on ip hostname form
Some way of checking for PTR without A - on zone export maybe?
Warn on multiple A's pointing to same address - should be OK - used for virtual hosts
Warn on too few MX's - should be 2 for valid zones
Modify modifydnsrecordform.php and bind9_zone.xsl to allow to add subdomains. 
	added 'NS' to selectbox 'recordtype'  
	use textbox 'host' as the subdomain and 'iphostname' as the name server for the subdomain. 
TTL on individual zone records - why?? What benefit? Bind specific or standard?
Access control - add group to data
	only fwdzone has admingrp field, but could be used to different group for DNS admins

Longer Term:
-----------
Some separate poller 
	show efficiency of networks relative to actually used addresses
Whois server
	http://www.generic-nic.net/sheets/practical/whois-en
Create IP address php class
Modify user details page for now just delete and recreate
Split "import from routing table" and "find free" into MAXTABLESIZE
	does not really make sense to do this as you will miss free blocks
	on start and end of range
IPv6
DBF Table name prefixes - useful for Oracle and shared databases
	where ipplan is installed with other apps
Move multiple subnets from one customer to another - sf request
