----------------------------------------------------
 Node Runner (0.6.0) CHANGELOG - Changes since 0.5.2
----------------------------------------------------

1. Removed first line of node.start script (the one
   that points to the php executable).  I will recommend
   that the node.start script now be run by feeding it
   to the php executable (eg. /bin/php node.start).
   Why?  Well, I'm sick of explaining how to create
   symlinks.
   
2. Changed default port of LOCALHOST node to 80
   (originally port 7), since more people will probably
   run this on their web servers rather than standalone
   boxes.
   
3. Added IP address to detailed email information.

4. Socket query types are now modular, meaning people
   can write their own custom queries, provided they
   follow a few simple guidelines from the README file.
   For examle, there was a large demand for ICMP queries,
   so ICMP is now an optional connection method when
   polling the network.  Consquently, status messages
   can now be customized from one query type to the next,
   meaning you can return something other than "UP" or
   "DOWN" if you have a firm understanding of how to
   modify the query functions.  In future versions, I
   will include user-submitted custom queries in the
   'contribs' folder within the package.
   
5. The node.start script has been modified to accomodate
   the new modular query format.  Many optimizations
   have been made to it as well.
   
6. The 'dont_poll' db table has been removed.  Its
   functionality within node.start has been replaced
   by a simple array.
   
7. The entire web interface has been redesigned with
   new functionality and features.
   
8. Created installer.php script for installation of NR.
   Installer should be compatible with both Unix and
   Windows.

9. SQL setup files have been moved into a sql directory
   and converted to .php files.  These files can be
   executed manually with the php interpreter, but it
   is recommended that they be used through the installer.


Modified Files: ALL

----------------------------------------------------
 Node Runner (0.5.2) CHANGELOG - Changes since 0.5.1
----------------------------------------------------

1. Fixed variable scoping problem resulting from
   having PHP's 'register_globals' turned off.  The
   'register_globals' directive is defaulting to
   'Off' in all new versions of PHP, so Node Runner
   has been fixed to accomodate this trend.
   According to the PHP developers, this should also
   make forging urls and sessions more difficult.
   Thanks to Joe Swanson for all the input and testing.

2. Minor cosmetic changes were made to the web
   interface, as well as various insignificant bug
   fixes and a bit of code cleanup.

3. Added global configuration option to prevent non-
   administrative users from starting the status
   monitor.

4. Added global configuration option to prevent non-
   administrative users from using the manual polling
   feature on the status monitor.

5. Added optional "Recent Failures" list to status
   monitor.  Feature can be enabled using global
   configuration variables.

6. Fixed bug from v0.5.1 that prevented non-admin
   users from viewing node information.
   

Modified files:
- html/(entire directory)
- etc/nr.inc
- INSTALL

----------------------------------------------------
 Node Runner (0.5.1) CHANGELOG - Changes since 0.5.0
----------------------------------------------------

1. Fixed syntax error in nr-mysql-setup.sql file.

2. Added functionality for checking status of secure
   (HTTP authentication) web pages.  Thanks to Matthew
   Soffen and Rudy Pawul for the idea and code.

3. Fixed bug in nr.inc: '$detailed_mail' was changed
   to '$detailed_email'.

4. Changed formatting of server-list.php and
   node-list.php for easier navigation.

5. Modified node-monitor-report.php to add default
   start and end date in form.  Currently defaults to
   current date for 'end' date, and 1 month prior for
   'start' date.

6. Modified 'BACKUP' option for database backups.
   Link now produces downloadable text file in .sql
   format.

7. Fixed bug that reports unresponsive Apache web
   servers as "UP" if $allow_refused variable is set
   within 'nr.inc' file.

8. Added code to measure page load times when querying
   urls rather than just checking for html status codes.
   This will fulfill the original need to monitor
   unreliable web application servers that happen to be
   separate from the web server itself (ex. Cold Fusion).

9. Fixed issue with META redirect in 'index.php' as some
   versions of Konqueror would not redirect properly.


Modified files:
- INSTALL
- node.start
- nr-mysql-setup.sql
- update-nr-to-v0.5.1.sql
- etc/nr.inc
- html/index.php
- html/input-page.php

- html/db-backup.php
- html/header.php

----------------------------------------------------
 Node Runner (0.5.0) CHANGELOG - Changes since 0.4.9
----------------------------------------------------

1. Modified the INSTALL document to clear up some confusion about
   the default selection of port 7 for the "Node Runner" node
   that is inserted as part of the base install.  A port should be
   selected that is accessible to be queried by the local machine.
   (i.e. If the machine cannot query itself, the php script will
   loop until it crashes.)
    
2. Fixed bug in status-monitor.php where condition color 
   remains green while percentage is equal to 0.

3. Copied phpCrontab.php file to local package from
   Sourceforge site in case local machine is denied
   Internet access.
   
4. Added comments field for each node and server entry, to
   be used for brief instructions or miscellaneous details
   about the node.  Thanks to Rudy Pawul for this idea.
    
5. Added database backup feature for dumping structure and
   data from all Node Runner tables to plain text within a
   browser window.  Ideally, this should allow for reconstruction
   of the NR database during disaster recovery.  Currently, 
   feature only works for MySQL, and absolute path to dump
   command may need to be modified (db-backup.php).

6. Added user login system to web interface.  In past
   versions, it was suggested that the NR web interface
   be secured with an .htaccess (or equivalent) file
   to prevent unauthorized access to server/node information.
   With the user login system, it should no longer be
   necessary to secure the NR directory on the web server.
   Ideally, non-admin users could view server/node
   information, print reports, etc., without modifying
   anything.  Thanks to Mark Stewart for this idea long ago.

7. Optimized node.start script.  The script now recognizes
   that if a node is found to be down, it should not bother
   polling any more servers that may depend on the down node
   during the iteration of the script.  Admins with large
   networks will notice the improvements in speed, as the
   script is less likely to run over itself if a major node
   goes offline.  As always, enabling the $debug option in
   the nr.inc file will produce output that might explain
   things a little better.

8. Changed naming convention of .sql files for upgrading
   Node Runner due to confusion during installations.
   The files have been appropriately named for their
   versions, such as update-nr-to-v0.5.0.sql.


Modified files:
- INSTALL
- nr-mysql-setup.sql
- update-nr-to-v0.5.0.sql
- All .sql files renamed (see #8 above)
- html/ (entire directory)
- etc/nr.inc
- node.start

----------------------------------------------------
 Node Runner (0.4.9) CHANGELOG - Changes since 0.4.8
----------------------------------------------------

1. Fixed bug in 'node.start' and 'status-monitor.php'
   that sends "UP" alerts when related "DOWN" alert
   was never sent.  (Only pertains to users of
   $firstmail option.)

2. Fixed bug in "html/connect.php" to point to proper
   location for 'mysql.inc' file.

3. Updated documentation to reflect requirement of
   PHP 4.x rather than supporting older 3.x versions
   of PHP.  Most people are using 4.x now anyway, and
   there are couple of array functions that have been
   used that are only available in 4.x.

4. created INSTALL file to separate installation
   instructions from general README information.

5. Expanded on installation instructions.

Modified files:
- node.start
- etc/nr.inc (just version number)
- html/connect.php
- html/status-monitor.php
- README
- INSTALL

----------------------------------------------------
 Node Runner (0.4.8) CHANGELOG - Changes since 0.4.7
----------------------------------------------------

1. Fixed corrupted 'nr.png' file.

2. Fixed bug in reporting mechanism that prevented
   use of any date old prior to Sept. 8, 2001
   (Unix time: 1000000000)

3. Added ability to run multiple node reports at one
   time, inserting CSS2-compatible page breaks in
   between each node table.

4. Added more functionality to reporting mechanism:
   a. Ability to simply report on all 'servers'
   b. Ability to simply report on all 'non-servers'
   c. Ability to generat summary report that just
      displays uptime percentage for each selected
      node.

4. Tweaked another setting related to $firstmail
   option in node.start to reflect a more accurate
   'lastnotif' [alert_log] value upon server
   resurrection.  Also fixed bug related to
   $firstmail that generates extra "DOWN" alerts.
   (Hopefully, this will be the last time the
   code is changed for the $firstmail option.)

Modified files:
- node.start
- html/node-monitor-report.php
- html/list.php
- html/style.css
- html/images/nr.png


----------------------------------------------------
 Node Runner (0.4.7) CHANGELOG - Changes since 0.4.6
----------------------------------------------------

1. Fixed bug in $firstmail option that allows the 
   option to actually work.  Go figure.

2. Fixed bug in status-monitor.php to allow manual
   polling of HTTP servers.

Only affected files:
- node.start
- etc/nr.inc
- html/status-monitor.php


----------------------------------------------------
 Node Runner (0.4.6) CHANGELOG - Changes since 0.4.5
----------------------------------------------------

1. The 'column count' bug in the nr-mysql-setup.sql
   has been fixed.

2. Removed superfluous time checks from node.start
   script.  These checks were deprecated with the
   implementation of 'resolved' in alert_log table.
   Scripts should now run more solid without creating
   phantom 'orphans'.

3. Added functionality of choosing how many minutes
   to wait after detecting a server as "DOWN" before
   NR sends its first email notice.  This may help
   to alleviate extra emails if you have an
   high-latency or flaky connection.

4. Changed 'node.start' script so re-queries (which
   are attempted at the start of the script) only
   make their attempt once instead of $max_attempts.


----------------------------------------------------
 Node Runner (0.4.5) CHANGELOG - Changes since 0.4.4
----------------------------------------------------

1. Added $nr_ver variable to etc/nr.inc file.  Thus
   far, it does nothing more than save me from
   physically coding it into the web interface.

2. Modified node-monitor-report.php to add a few new
   features.  Reports can now be narrowed down to
   specified days per week and timeframe during any
   of those days.  This came as a special request
   for people whose bonuses are based (via contract)
   on uptime from 7am to 5:30pm, Monday through
   Friday.

3. Added feature to limit the number of alerts sent
   during a node's downtime.  Configurable as
   $max_alerts variable in etc/nr.inc.

4. Removed unused 'function.php' file from html
   directory.  This was a development file that was
   unintentionally included in the 0.4.4 release.

5. All html code from web interface has been cleaned
   up and standardized.

6. Fixed bug in status monitor where downtime field
   in alert_log table was not being updated when
   node is successfully polled via clicking its name.
   (Refers to 'CLICK TO POLL MANUALLY' link.)

7. Added utility (clean-logs.php) for cleaning up
   old entries in the alert_log db table.  This is
   mostly for people with limited disk space, or for
   those who don't wish to keep records after long
   periods of time.



----------------------------------------------------
 Node Runner (0.4.4) CHANGELOG - Changes since 0.4.3
----------------------------------------------------

1. Added status-monitor.php to be used as a viewable
   status screen on a public computer.  (At least
   that's what I'm using it for.)  Ideally, this
   should allow users who don't receive email alerts
   to passively monitor network status and possibly
   report errors if they are missed.
   Ideal requirements are 4.x+ browser with resolution
   of 1024 x 768 or higher.  Functionality will not
   be lost with lesser resolution, but I cannot
   guarantee how good it will look.

2. Fixed bug in node-list.php and server-list.php
   where url was not being encoded properly when
   disabling nodes/servers.

3. Added link in node-list.php and server-list.php
   that allows you to view the hierarchy of
   dependencies from the selected node down.  This
   comes in handy when trying to troubleshoot a
   mistyped address.

4. Fixed bug in mail-settings.php that where url
   was not being properly encoded when changing
   group settings.

5. Added debug level to node.start script.  Set
   $debug to 1 in nr.inc file, and the node.start
   script will output status for each server and
   execution time to screen or text file.  (See
   README for full details.)

6. Fixed bug in node-monitor-report.php where
   minimum, maximum, and average uptime duration
   were not being displayed properly.  I don't know
   why I didn't catch this before...

7. Added $allow_refused variable to nr.inc.  This
   will allow 'Connection Refused (111)' errors
   returned by fsockopen to be considered respondant.
   This is an experimental measure for the meantime.
   We'll see if anyone complains about it...



----------------------------------------------------
 Node Runner (0.4.3) CHANGELOG - Changes since 0.4.2
----------------------------------------------------

1. Modified view-change-node-settings.php to update
   changed nodes (with "DOWN" status) to orphaned
   log entries.  This was accomplished by changing
   the 'resolved' field to 'O' instead of 'N'.
   Respondant nodes will simply be updated normally.

2. Modified node-list.php and server-list.php to
   "orphan" alert_log entries if server/node is
   disabled or deleted.

3. Updated node.start to reflect above change.  Made
   certain that "orphaned" alert_log entries are
   ignored when re-polling "DOWN" servers and nodes.

4. Fixed bug in node-list.php that prevents deletion
   of nodes.

5. Fixed obscure bug in node.start that would
   incorrectly increment downtime for server even
   if it's dependency went down during the server's
   downtime.

6. Created style.css to be used for web interface
   pages (uniformity always looks professional).



----------------------------------------------------
 Node Runner (0.4.2) CHANGELOG - Changes since 0.4.1
----------------------------------------------------

1. Added ability to schedule which days of the week
   the node will be queried. This feature is
   configurable through the web interface, and
   should allow you to set your cron to run every
   day.

2. Created update-nr-v0.4.1.sql to update db tables
   for "days" functionality.

3. Modified format of node-list.php and
   server-list.php to accomodate "days" feature.

4. Modified alert_log db table: added new field
   'resolved' for re-polling dead nodes.  In previous
   versions, anomalies have been reported where
   dead nodes were not getting re-polled after first
   increment of $delay is counted in the db table (due
   to my fuzzy logic).

5. Modified node.start and related .php files
   to accomodate new alert_log table format.

6. Fixed $dbtype variable syntax in nr.inc - the
   trailing ";" was left off by mistake.



--------------------------------------------------
 Node Runner (0.4.1) CHANGELOG - Changes since 0.4
--------------------------------------------------

1. Added ability to determine how many query
   attempts to make before Node Runner decides
   a node is down (default is 3). This should
   alleviate false alerts on nodes that may just
   be slow to respond.



--------------------------------------------------
 Node Runner (0.4) CHANGELOG - Changes since 0.3
--------------------------------------------------

1. Modified format of generated reports after
   receiving legal threat from commercial vendor.
   Apparently, mine looked a little too much like
   theirs, even though I've never heard of them.

2. Modified node-list.php and server-list.php
   to allow change/deletion of nodes/servers, but
   only *after* the node is disabled.  Also added
   extra check if disabling a node to make sure no
   other nodes are dependent on it.  (Provides a
   list of dependencies to resolve before disabling
   is allowed.)

3. Added [very limited] ability to query urls.
   This ability is limited to checking for a valid
   HTTP header [GET] response of "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
   from the node.  Anyone who knows what they're
   doing should have no problem hacking this to work
   for their custom queries.
   I added this functionality simply to track
   responsiveness of our Cold Fusion server, since
   it cannot be polled as a socket.  Often times,
   the web server appears to be running, while the
   Cold Fusion server hangs up (NT box, typical).

4. Modified web interface in appropriate places
   to accomodate new url querying feature.

5. Created update-nr-v03.sql to update db for url
   querying.

6. Consolidated add-mail-group.php and
   view-change-mail-settings.php into single file
   "mail-settings.php".

7. Code has been revised to use database abstraction
   layers.  The only layer currently kid-tested and
   mother-approved is MySQL.  It shouldn't be too
   difficult for someone who knows what they're doing
   to whip up some layers for other databases also.
   My biggest hangup on this was testing.  PHP 4.0.6
   seems to have a few bugs to work out for support
   of PostgreSQL, and commercial dbs (Oracle, M$SQL)
   are not easy to come by.
   I've started a few layers for different dbs, but
   I won't distribute them with the release package
   until they've been tested.  I'll post them in the
   files area of SourceForge in case anyone wants to
   take a crack at testing/fixing them.




--------------------------------------------------
 Node Runner (0.3) CHANGELOG - Changes since 0.2
--------------------------------------------------

NOTICE: 
Version 0.3 uses a new method of checking for recently
"up" servers.  I would recommend flushing your alert_log
table if you install this new version.  If you don't,
you're likely to get a whole bunch of strange alert
messages until the system gets back on track.


1. Removed lines (from input-page.php) to input new node
   records in alert_log table. (can't remember why I did
   this...)

2. Cleaned up node.start section that queries for
   recently "up" servers.  Should be a little more
   dependable now.

3. Added reporting mechanism accessible through browser
   interface. This was designed purely for managerial
   eyes, with neatly formatted numbers and descriptions.

4. Consolidated a view-change-server-settings.php
   to use only view-change-node-settings.php.

5. Conducted brief clean up of html files. I realize
   this needs to be done on a larger scale (their
   pretty messy), but my ambitions focus elsewhere.

6. Added support for custom query timeouts per node.
   Recognized this need with some slow network lines.

7. Added support for custom monitor times per node
   rather than old method based on cron schedule.
   Days of the week will still need to be determined
   by cron.

8. Changed name of initial database setup and version
   update sql files. These were rewritten by hand,
   so if you have trouble with them, take a closer
   look.

9. Updated README to reflect changed files / configs.




--------------------------------------------------
 Node Runner (0.2) CHANGELOG - Changes since 0.1
--------------------------------------------------
1. Sender email referenced in 'node.start' file has
   been converted to a variable referenced by nr.inc

2. Added link in main index to phpCrontab Tutorial
   Tool to answer newbie questions about scheduling
   Node Runner in the cron.

3. Changed all references from "Object" to "Node"
   on web interface.  SQL tables will remain as they
   are currently named.

4. Alterations made to table ALERT_LOG for the express
   purpose of tracking the downtime of various servers.

5. Fixed bug so updated information is also passed to
   the alert_log table.

6. Removed references to status_screen table.  This
   was originally planned as a realtime monitor via
   browser, but I'm holding off until I can re-work
   the concept in Java.

7. Removed ability to disable "nodes" from web
   interface.  This feature will be used in later
   versions, but accomplishes nothing at the moment.

8. "Recent Failures" link in web interface now lists
    downtime for each node failure.  "alert_log" table
    was modified to accomodate this new feature.

9. Notifications are now sent when "down" node
   begins responding once again.  Emails are similar,
   just a message stating status ("UP" or "DOWN").
