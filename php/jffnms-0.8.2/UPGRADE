This file explains the upgrade procedure between versions:

0.8.1 to 0.8.2
==============

    0. You are adviced to upgrade your PHP and PostgreSQL (if you use that) versions before the upgrade,
	because some new features may need that. 
	
	The new poller is still experimental, and its not enabled by default.

    Replace the <patch tar.gz path> with the actual path to the patch files,
    '../jffnms-upgrade-0.8.1-to-0.8.2' if you are using jffnms-upgrade-0.8.1-to-0.8.2.tar.gz or 
    '/opt/jffnms-0.8.2/docs/upgrade' if you are using jffnms-0.8.2.tar.gz
    
    1. Apply the code patch: 
	# cd /opt/jffnms 
	# patch -p1 < <patch tar.gz path>/jffnms-0.8.1-to-0.8.2.patch 

	If you have not changed the code, there should not be any errors.
	Replace apache.apache with your HTTPd username and group (nobody, httpd, etc)

    2. Upgrade the DB: 
	MySQL:
	    Backup in case of failure:
		# mysqldump --opt -ujffnms -pjffnms jffnms > /tmp/jffnms.backup.mysql
	
	    Upgrade the MySQL Tables:
		# cat docs/upgrade/mysql/jffnms-0.8.1-to-0.8.2.mysql.diff* | mysql -u jffnms -pjffnms jffnms

	PgSQL:
	    Backup in case of failure:
		# pg_dump -U jffnms jffnms -dROc > /tmp/jffnms.backup.pgsql

	    Upgrade the PgSQL Tables:
		# cat docs/upgrade/pgsql/jffnms-0.8.1-to-0.8.2.pgsql.diff* | psql jffnms jffnms

    3. Copy the new binary files: 

	# cp -Rv <patch tar.gz path>/files/* /opt/jffnms/

    4. Change Ownership
    
    	# chown -R apache:apache *

	    OR if you used the new Instalation method: 
	# chown -R jffnms:jffnms *  

    
	And then re apply the permissions to the /opt/jffnms folder:
	
	# chmod -R ug+rw *

	
    5. Verify Everything is ok:
	Go to the Setup page at
	    http://youserver/jffnms/admin/setup.php (or the path you set)
	    
	    Check everything, make the corrections and SAVE the Configuration anyway.
