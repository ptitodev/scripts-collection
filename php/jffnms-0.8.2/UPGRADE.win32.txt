How to do an upgrade on Windows?
--------------------------------

Please read all this note before executing something, so you can understand all the process.

Step 1 - Code Update:
=====================

    1. Rename the c:\jffnms folder to jffnms-old
    2. Rename the new jffnms version folder (like c:\jffnms-0.7.3) to c:\jffnms
    3. Copy your c:\jffnms-old\rrd folder to c:\jffnms\rrd 
    4. Copy the c:\jffnms-old\rrdtool.exe and nmap.exe to c:\jffnms\
    5. Re-apply the permissions, give the jffnms user FULL CONTROL over c:\jffnms
	     
    6. At this point you have the new version in place with your old version data. 
	The only thing missing is a correct configuration. You have to go to your setup.php 
	and reconfigure everything like you did when you first install it. (Step 3)


Step 2 - Database Update:
=========================

    You have to send every file in the c:\jffnms\docs\upgrade\mysql to the mysql daemon :
    
    1. Backup in case of failure:
	c:\> c:\mysql\bin\mysqldump.exe --opt -u root jffnms > c:\jffnms.backup.mysql
    
    2. Go to the DB upgrade folder
	c:\> cd \jffnms\docs\upgrade\mysql

    3. Replace OLD with your current JFFNMS version number (like 0.7.2) and NEW with the new version number (like 0.7.3)
	c:\jffnms\docs\upgrade\mysql> dir jffnms-OLD-to-NEW*	(look at all the file names)

    4. Apply the DB changes
	c:\jffnms\docs\upgrade\mysql> c:\mysql\bin\mysql.exe -u root jffnms < <Put every Filename here>
	
	or, as suggested by Michael Mayers:
	
	    If in .cmd file:
	    for /f "tokens=*" %%i in ('dir jffnms* /b') DO c:\mysql\bin\mysql.exe -u root jffnms < %%i
	
	    If not in .cmd file:
	    for /f "tokens=*" %i in ('dir jffnms* /b') DO c:\mysql\bin\mysql.exe -u root jffnms < %i


Step 3 - Check Everything:
==========================
    
    Go to your setup in http://yourserver/admin/setup.php (put the correct path here).
    
    Check if everything is ok, and Save the configuration.
