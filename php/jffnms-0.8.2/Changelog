    - New Launcher thread manager, its a generic way to handle item processing to child process, 
	while keeping the load down. It will launch a fixed number of threads and send them work.
	Requested by: Travis Johnson <tlj |a|t| ida |d|o|t| net>
    
    - New Poller using the new launcher.  (poller2.php)
	Its simpler than the old poller (which is kept for some features like DMII and Satellite that are 
	not implemented here). This is still experimental and only works in Unix.
	
    - Network Autodiscovery.
	Allows you to add 1 or more seed networks and snmp communities to a zone, and when the daemon runs,
	it will discover the devices in that network and in attached networks. This is very useful to add
	a lot of hosts easily. Experimental Too.

    - Support for SNMPv2 and SNMPv3, Including 64 bits counters.
	For SNMPv1 and SNMPv3 we are using the integrated PHP functions and for SNMPv2 we are calling the
	net-snmp executables (snmpget, snmpwalk and snmpset) that is a little slow, but it works.
	When using SNMPv2 or v3, the 64 bit OIDs will be used automatically for input and output, 
	bytes and packet coutners.
	Requested by: A lot of people

    - New Backend Configuration Format, uses one defaults file (conf/jffnms.conf.defaults) and
	one user-config file (conf/jffnms.conf) for easier automated upgrades.

	Also includes Min/Max limit alerting.
	Requested by: Daniel Afonso <dafonso |a|t| afonsoconsulting |d|o|t| com>

    - New Interfaces Autodiscovery using the new launcher, replaced the old autodiscovery under the same name, all features re-implemented.

    - Managed RRDtool: one RRDtool process is called by each poller and we use the open connection to multiple operations,
	reducing the fork load. Only works on Unix.

    - New Host fields: Creation, Modification, Last Poll Date and Last Poll duration Time, useful for debugging.

    - Cisco PIX syslog events matching and filtering.
	By: David Lima <DLIMA |a|t| fr |d|o|t| scc |d|o|t| com>
	
    .GUI:

JFFNMS 0.7.7 Released 2004-04-05
================================

*New Features:

    - New Login Screen, a new DHTML login screen, is selectable from the setup.
	You can also add a logo to the page. This new method uses sessions/cookies to store a session id,
	and internall is faster because we don't have to auth in every page request, which made some IDS ring.
	An event is created when a user tries to login successfully or not.

	Old method (HTTP AUTH) is still there, and will continue to be supported.

    - New Tools Framework.
	This system allows changes to be made to interfaces on the host.
	Examples provided for Changing the Interface description and Admin Status on Routers and
	to list or finish TCP connections on agents that support that feature (Cisco's TCP MIB).

	A new event (Tool Action) is generated everytime something is changed using this tools.

    - New Profile option to select which "View" Page do you want to see when you login.

    - New ToolBox Interface Alarms widget. This allows access to more pages related to the selected interface.
	Like Tools, Edit, Events and Performance. This is shown when you pass over an interface in the HTML or DHTML view types.

    - New Event Type "internal" for JFFNMS related events. Also added a new option to hide the Host Name in the events viewer.
	This event is used by the new Login Screen.

    - 'Or' Type matching for Triggers.
	Requested by: Alexandru Thomae
	
    - Poller, Autodiscovery, and Satellite Distribution now verifies that no other process with the same name are running.
	To avoid duplicate processes. This works only on Linux.

	Requested by: David Lima.
	
    - Alarm Backend now supports to set the time-span between down and up events, 
	and the value to assume (or not) when no result is given by the poller.
	Also, better (human readable) return values are given.

    - RRD Backend again supports update on one DS by call. 
	This is to make simplier poller groups when only one value is graphed.
	And also to check if performance is better than doing all the DS at the end.
	
    - New poller option to poll just the DMII interaces on a host.
	Requested by: David Lima.

    - snmp_interfaces_status_all now checks if the host has more than 30 interfaces before doing the walk, 
	if it does not, then uses normal snmp_get's
	
    - When ACK'ing summarized events ('Message Repeated N times'), all events are now ACKd rather than just one.
	Requested by: Thomas Mangin

    - Interfaces Alarm Screen now autodetects the screen width at start, so no more 'Big Screen' View types.
    
    - New folder ('engine/shared') to store shared code (ie. that may be required for pollers and for tools), 
	and a new function to call them jffnms_shared().

    - Satellite now works with HTTPS, new https_post_message function, that uses the CURL extension.
	by: Chris Landegent

    - Allow interfaces to be checked only every X minutes (N > 5), useful when used with the TCP Content Checking.
	Requested by: Chris Landegent

    - Anonymous customer logins. Just define a customer with no password.
	Example URL: http://youserver/jffnms/?user=customer_username&pass=&logout=1
	Requested by: Chris Tuska

    - Direct Graph download. Useful for embedding them on a site, examples:
	- Get the traffic graph from one interface:
	    http://youserver/jffnms/view_performance.php?interace_id=332&want_graph=traffic

	- Get the Aggregation Traffic graph of a whole host:
	    http://youserver/jffnms/view_performance.php?host=6&want_graph=aggr&graph_type=traffic
	
	- Use with the Anonymous logins
	    http://youserver/jffnms/view_performance.php?user=customer1&pass=&logout=1&interace_id=332&want_graph=traffic

    - Syslog Consolidator has a Position parameter now, to handle the order on which the syslog RegExps are tried.

	Requested by: Richard Sears

    - Manual Add of TCP Ports, now its possible to add any port number you want manually, 
	or to set up the same port a more than one time with different testing Regular Expressions.

    - CPU Usage and Load Average SLA for Linux Hosts.	

    - CPU and Memory Usage SLA for Cisco Routers.

	When you mark "Fixed Admin Status" the show type of the interface (Show, Mark Disable, Don't show) will no be modified by the poller.
	The Default is not checked, so the poller will automatically modify the Admin Status/View Type of the interface.

    - New trap_receiver coded in PHP, now you can use the trap functions with postgresql, because it uses the JFFNMS DB abstraction.
	by: Aaron Aubman
	
    - New Way to use Satellites "Local Master", this means the Satellite will poll the values, store them locally AND send it to the master too.

	Requested by: Thomas Mangin

    - Performance Graph Title was badly calculated.
	Reported by: Pierre-Damien Gatouillat

JFFNMS 0.7.5 Released 2003-12-16
================================

*New Features:

    - Per Interface-Type Fields:
	
	Until now every interface had the same fields, for some interface types this was ok, but others required more or different fields,
	so this new feature allows different fields per interface type. 
	    ie: Linux TC now has Rate and Ceil fields, and its not using the BW in/out fields, TCP Ports don't have IP address or BW, etc.
	
	This was one of the big "barriers" in the internal design of JFFNMS, so I'm glad I finally made it configurable/modular.
    
	- DB: 3 new tables: interface_types_fields, interface_types_field_types, and interface_values
	- GUI: Manual Discovery has a new layout and includes all the specific interface fields.
	- GUI: View Interfaces shows all the 'description' fields and has a better text layout
	- API: interfaces_update updates every interface value not just the interfaces table.
	- API: Events Text now can include any interface type specific fields
	- API: Poller Parameters can include any interface type specific fields

	- AD Tracked Fields are set from the Interface Type Fields.
	- SLA: now you can use SLA expressions with the name of each interface type specific field

	- Changed all discovery, poller and backend scripts to use the new and specific fields, ie:
	    
	    - ALL: changed 'descr' fields to 'description' 
	    - Physical: Pings to Send configurable per interface
	    - BGP: Separated field for Local IP , Remote IP and ASN values.
	    - Applications: Number of Instanses stored in DB.
	    - Linux TC: Specific Ceil and Rate fields. 
    	    - Storage: Specific Size Field (it was bandwidth before)
	    - TCP: Check content option now allows for a specific URL to be included
	    - Reachability: Now you can configure the fping parameters per interface
	    - Verify Interface Number Backend now uses specific Index Field.
	    - RRD Backend gets the RRD Structure from the Interface Type Fields.

	Important Notes:
	----------------

	* If you have "custom" interface types, please read the UPGRADE file carefully
	
	* By default we not 'track' the network interface's description via autodiscovery, so if you don't want to loose 
	    your custom interface descriptions, please disable the field tracking via the Polling & Discovery=>Interface Types Screen. 

    - All AD changes to an interface are summarized on one event.
    
    - Cleanup old Events and Alarms integrated to cleanup_raw_tables.
	- the number of days is configurable via setup.php (Defaults to 7 Days of Raw Events, and 60 Days of Normal Events/Alarms)
	- We try to repair the tables using a REPAIR/OPTIMIZE or VACUUM command at the end. This is to avoid index problems.

    - Per Host 'Polling Enabled' Option to disallow polling of all host interfaces more easily.
	Requested by: Richard Sears
    
    - Host View option now acts over the View option of its interfaces, so if the Host is in Don't show or Mark Disabled, it will look as 
	all its interfaces where in the same state.
	Reqiested by: Richard Sears

    - Experimental Poller (for networks with a lot of hosts)
	A new polling system that keeps a number of pollers running, and distributed the polling load by interface to them.
	This allow us to poll a lot of hosts without the problems of lauching one poller for each host. This is still experimental, don't use 
	it yet for production enviorments. It Requires the SHMOP and PCNTL PHP Modules to work. 
	By: Anders Karlsson
	
    - RRD_Analyzer: SLA is now a seprated analyzer, this mimics all other plugin scripts, SLA still the only one implemented.

    - When a Network Interface (IFMIB) has AdminStatus 'down', it will be set to 'Mark Disabled' automatically, 
	also when the interface is back in AdminStatus 'up', it will be set to 'Show'.
	Requested by: Richard Sears
	
    - GUI: Interface Viewer (Status Map) now includes a link to the interface editor
    
    - GUI: Graph legends now include the Site Name.
    
    - GUI: Alarmed Interfaces view now includes the Host Name of the interfaces in a new line
	Requested by: Chris Landegent
	
    - GUI: When inside a Host in the Interface Viewer, clicking on the "card" (gray) box will show all the graph for that interface type

    - GUI: Added the Current and Last Polled Date to the Performance Viewer
	Requested by: Smith Chen
	
    - API: Added fetch_ds() method to the interfaces class, to allow an RRDTool Fetch remotely.	

    - API: Temporal Buffer Backend supports calling the same variable more than once, until it has a value.

    - API: Poller Plan now allows to filter by type
    
    - API: Interfaces_Add can use an array as parameter to define more than the host_id of the new record, but only interface table fields

    - UTILS: Added Debug option to jffnms-snmp, to check the output tree.
