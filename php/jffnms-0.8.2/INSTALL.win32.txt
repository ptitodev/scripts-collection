	LoadModule php5_module c:/php/php5apache2.dll
	AddType application/x-httpd-php .php

	NameVirtualHost *

	<VirtualHost *>
    	    ServerAdmin webmaster@your-domain.com
    	    DocumentRoot c:\jffnms\htdocs
    	    ServerName nms.yourdomain.com
	    DirectoryIndex index.php
	    LimitRequestLine 20000
	</VirtualHost>

	* Make sure you modify the above information to match your needed settings

Configure PHP:	
	Make sure you have this on your php.ini file:

	register_globals = On
	register_argc_argv = On
	allow_url_fopen = On
	
	extension_dir = c:\php\ext
	
	(Uncomment the following):
	extension=php_gd2.dll
	extension=php_snmp.dll
	extension=php_mysql.dll
	extension=php_sockets.dll
	
	SMTP = your.mail.server.com	(set it to your mail server IP or DNS name)

	Now Restart the Apache Service.

	if you don't change these, JFFNMS will not work.

Configure MySQL:

	To create the JFFNMS DB run the following:
	
	Check the path to mysql.exe

	c:\> c:\Program Files\MySQL\MySQL Server 4.1\bin\mysql.exe -u root -p<Root MySQL Password>
	
	mysql>CREATE DATABASE jffnms;
	mysql>GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON jffnms.* TO jffnms@localhost IDENTIFIED BY 'jffnms';  
	mysql>FLUSH PRIVILEGES;  
	mysql>quit;
	
	And:

	c:\> c:\Program Files\MySQL\MySQL Server 4.1\bin\mysql.exe -ujffnms -pjffnms jffnms < c:\jffnms\docs\jffnms-0.8.x.mysql 	
    
	Replace x with the version you are installing.

Configure JFFNMS:
	
	-----------------
	I M P O R T A N T
	-----------------
	
	Go to: http://yourserver/

	Verify and change (if needed) the options. 
	
	Don't mind the errors on diff, neato, smsclient, fping, ntpq, PgSQL and SOAP.
	
	Save the configuration and change the values until everything needed is Green.
	
	Everything else SHOULD be OK.
