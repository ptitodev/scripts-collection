In this mode, the command returns immediately without waiting for the task to complete and the output is a Task object. <br/><br/><p class="table-title">Long Description</p>By default, PowerCLI cmdlets return only after completion of the requested tasks. If you want the cmdlet to return immediately, without waiting for the tasks to complete, you can specify the RunAsync parameter. In this case, the cmdlet returns Task objects instead of its usual output. <br/><br/>The Status property of a returned Task object contains a snapshot of the task initial state. This state is not automatically updated and has one of the following values - Error, Queued, Running, and Success. To refresh the task status, pass the Task object to the Get-Task cmdlet. To interrupt a running task, use the Stop-Task cmdlet. If you want to observe the progress of a running task and wait for its completion before initiating other commands, use the Wait-Task cmdlet.<br/><br/>	Example 1:  Running Remove-VM With and Without the RunAsync Parameter.<br/><br/>		     Remove-VM $vmList  <br/><br/>		     //The command returns without an output when all virtual machines stored in the $vmList variable are removed (simultaneously or not). <br/><br/>		     Remove-VM $vmList -RunAsync<br/><br/>		     //The command returns immediately and the output is one or more Task objects. <br/><br/>In PowerCLI,  the RunAsync parameter affects only the cmdlets invocation and does not control whether the initiated tasks run consecutively or in parallel. For example, the virtual machines passed to the Remove-VM cmdlet might be removed simultaneously or consecutively depending on the PowerCLI internal design.<br/><br/>To make sure that tasks initiated by a cmdlet do not run in parallel, run the cmdlet in a loop, each time applying it to a single object. <br/><br/>	Example 2: Removing Virtual Machines Consecutively. <br/><br/>		foreach ($vm in $vmList)<br/>		{<br/>  			 Remove-VM $vm1<br/>		}<br/><br/><br/>Send feedback to docfeedback@vmware.com | Copyright (C) VMware, Inc.
