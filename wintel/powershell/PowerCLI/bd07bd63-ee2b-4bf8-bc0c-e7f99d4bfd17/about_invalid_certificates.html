If the certificate is not recognized, the Invalid Certificate prompt appears.<br/><br/>You can select one of the four options provided by the Invalid Certificate prompt:<br/><br/>- Deny - Cancel the server connection.<br/><br/>- Connect once - Establish the server connection and suppress further warnings for the current PowerShell session.<br/><br/>- Add a permanent exception for the server_address/certificate pair - Persist the server certificate in the PowerCLI Trusted Certificate Store (PCTCS) for the current user and establish the server connection.<br/><br/>- Add a permanent exception for all users -  Persist the server/certificate pair both in the current user PowerCLI Trusted Certificate Store (PCTCS) and in the All Users PCTCS and establish the server connection.<br/><br/>To set the default behavior of vSphere PowerCLI when no valid certificates are recognized, use the InvalidCertificateAction parameter of the Set-PowerCLIConfiguration cmdlet.<br/><br/>POWERCLI TRUSTED CERTIFICATE STORE (PSTCS) <br/><br/>The PowerCLI Trusted Certificate Store (SslCertificateExceptions.csv) is a CSV file with two columns: server_address and certificate_thumbprint. You can edit the (PSTCS) manually by using a text editor.<br/><br/>There are two PSTCS files: <br/><br/>- The current user PSTCS is located in the %APPDATA%\VMware\PowerCLI directory of the user.  <br/>- The All Users PSTCS is located in %ALL USERS APPDATA%\VMware\PowerCLI. <br/><br/><br/>The local certificate storage file is purposely simple and you can easily import and export certificates from one machine to another or fill it with certificates automatically.<br/><br/>Send feedback to docfeedback@vmware.com | Copyright (C) VMware, Inc.
