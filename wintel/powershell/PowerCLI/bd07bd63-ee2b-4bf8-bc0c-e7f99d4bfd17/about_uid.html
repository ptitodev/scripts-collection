The key and the value within a pair are separated by an equal sign (&quot;=&quot;).  <br/><br/>For example, the Uid if a virtual CD Drive might be &quot;/VIServer=powershell@vc41-ga.pc:443/VirtualMachine=VirtualMachine-vm-88/CDDrive=3001/&quot;.<br/><br/>To retrieve the Uid of an object, use its Uid property.<br/>For example:<br/>	$vm = Get-VM -Name aaa<br/>	$vm.Uid<br/><br/>To ease work with Uids, there is a global Powershell variable $UidUtil that provides methods for processing Uids.<br/><br/><br/>LONG DESCRIPTION<br/>Although the name of an object is unique within a server, PowerCLI allows you to run cmdlets on multiple servers and this can lead to ambiguity. This means that the name or the short ID you have provided to a cmdlet might correspond to multiple objects on different servers. To avoid this, you can identify a PowerCLI object on a server or across multiple servers by specifying its Uid (unique identifier). The Uid contains information about the target server.<br/><br/>A Uid is a string that consists of one or more key-value pairs separated by a slash (&quot;/&quot;). The key and the value within a pair are separated by an equal sign (&quot;=&quot;). The first key-value pair represents the server connection. The objects which have no server-side analog and only live in the local memory start with &quot;/Local=/&quot;. <br/>A Uid is said to be parent of another Uid if it can be obtained from the child Uid by removing one or more key-value pairs from the end of the child Uid.<br/><br/>PROCESSING UIDS<br/><br/>The global variable $UidUtil provides the following methods for processing UIds:<br/><br/>bool IsUid(string str)  -  Checks if the specified string is a valid Uid.<br/><br/>string Append(string uid, string key, string value)  -  Appends the specified key and value to the specified Uid to form a child Uid. Any special characters will be encoded (in the same way as EncodeValue method).<br/><br/>string GetKey(string uid)  -  Retrieves the key of the rightmost Uid element.<br/><br/>string GetValue(string uid)  -  Retrieves the value of the rightmost Uid element.<br/><br/>string GetValue(string uid, string key)  -  Retrieves the value of the leftmost Uid element which has the specified key. If the key is not present ? returns $null.<br/><br/>string EncodeValue(string plainString)  -  Encodes a string so that it can be used as a value of a Uid element (escapes delimiters).<br/><br/>string DecodeValue(string encodedString)  -  Reverses the effect of Encode.<br/><br/>string GetParentUid(string uid)  -  Returns the parent Uid of &#39;uid&#39;. <br/>Example: <br/>	if $uid is equal to:<br/>	&quot;/VIServer=powershell@vc41-ga.pc:443/VirtualMachine=VirtualMachine-vm-88/CDDrive=3001/&quot;<br/>	<br/>	Then $UidUtil.GetParentUid($uid) will return: <br/>	&quot;/VIServer=powershell@vc41-ga.pc:443/VirtualMachine=VirtualMachine-vm-88/&quot;<br/><br/>string GetParentUid(string uid, string parentKey)  -  Returns the shortest parent Uid of &#39;uid&#39; which has a rightmost Uid element with the specified key. If the key is not present ? returns $null.<br/>Example: <br/>	if $uid is equal to:<br/>	&quot;/VIServer=powershell@vc41-ga.pc:443/VirtualMachine=VirtualMachine-vm-88/CDDrive=3001/&quot;<br/>	<br/>	Then $UidUtil.GetParentUid($uid, &quot;VirtualMachine&quot;) will return: <br/>	&quot;/VIServer=powershell@vc41-ga.pc:443/VirtualMachine=VirtualMachine-vm-88/&quot;<br/>	<br/>	And  $UidUtil.GetParentUid($uid, &quot;VIServer&quot;) will return: <br/>	&quot;/VIServer=powershell@vc41-ga.pc:443/&quot;<br/><br/>string GetConnectionUid(string uid)  -  Gets the Uid which represents the connection for this object. The connection Uid element is the first Uid element.<br/><br/>bool IsOnConnection(string uid, string connectionKey, string connectionValue) - Reports whether uid belongs to the specified connection.<br/><br/>void GetHelp() ? Displays an about_ article with help information about the Uid concept and description of the methods? functionality.<br/><br/>The $UidUtil Powershell variable also exposes the following properties:<br/><br/>string ElementDelimiter  -  The delimiter used to separate the different elements of a Uid<br/>string KeyValueDelimiter  -  The delimiter used to separate the key and the value of a Uid element<br/><br/><br/>Send feedback to docfeedback@vmware.com | Copyright (C) VMware, Inc.
